                        I study at Brigham Young University - Idaho, I am a software engineer with a focus on
                        full stack development. In my educational career I have learned to write professional
                        code, present myself in both a technical and professional setting, and work together with classmates to
                        complete projects within deadlines.

                        I have been fascinated with computers their inner-workings since I was young.
                        Often I found myself switching components in the computer to make it faster,
                        sometimes discovering that some of the components didn't make a difference.
                        I later became interested in the software side of my computer; eventually,
                        looking up how to learn to code on my own. It wasn't until college that I found
                        a true passion for software development, more specifically web development.
